# Text-Parser
Created By Katelyn Steele
This is a text parser that started out as a test question in a job interview. Feeling disappointed in how it looked at the end of the interview I added more features, a display and now working on playing with the Facebook SDK. I Will probably continue to add and make changes as I see fit.
